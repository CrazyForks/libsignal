v0.76.0

- The net-related RequestedInformation type in Java, Swift, and Rust has been renamed to ChallengeOption, and in some cases relocated, to reflect its broader usage. The cases within the type have not been changed.

- Java: documentation is now produced by Dokka instead of javadoc; for Kotlin-flavored docs, you can consume the -dokka Maven artifact instead of the -javadoc one.
